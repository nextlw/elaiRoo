Realiza uma busca na web usando um motor de busca. Retorna uma lista de resultados, cada um contendo t√≠tulo, link e um breve snippet. Pode usar APIs de busca espec√≠ficas (como Jina, Serper, Brave) se configuradas pelo usu√°rio e se a l√≥gica da ferramenta suportar, ou recorrer a uma busca gen√©rica em motores como DuckDuckGo/Google.

‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY XML FORMAT - EVERY PARAMETER MUST BE IN XML TAGS:

<web_search>
<query>your search terms here</query>
<engine>jina</engine>
<num_results>10</num_results>
</web_search>

Parameters:
- query: (REQUIRED) Search terms - MUST be inside <query></query> tags
- engine: (optional) Search engine - MUST be inside <engine></engine> tags
- num_results: (optional) Number of results - MUST be inside <num_results></num_results> tags

üö´ WRONG - This will cause "query parameter undefined" error:
<web_search>
comunica√ß√£o SSE     ‚Üê Missing <query> tags
jina               ‚Üê Missing <engine> tags
</web_search>

‚úÖ CORRECT - Each parameter has its own XML tags:
<web_search>
<query>comunica√ß√£o SSE Server-Sent Events</query>
<engine>jina</engine>
<num_results>15</num_results>
</web_search>

Guidelines for the model's behavior mode when using web_search:
- Depth and Exhaustiveness: Conduct deep searches, exploring all nuances.
- Logical Reasoning: In case of doubt, seek references for similar problems and use logical reasoning to solve them.
- Do Not Give Up: NEVER say you don't know the answer or can't respond. In case of an impasse, review accumulated knowledge, reformulate the search strategy, and try new approaches.
- Practical Examples: ALWAYS provide practical examples of how the information can be used.
- If prevented from visiting a page by some method, try again with another strategy. In case of failures, research how to solve the specific access problem without compromising the quality of the main response ${args.cwd}.
- Whenever possible, try to seek updated information by validating the publication date against the current date.
- When appropriate, i.e., when information is available via an API that does not require credentials, search for the API documentation, construct an HTTP request with the necessary parameters in a sandbox, and obtain the response. Treat the response as a web page response and get the main content as markdown.
- In cases where credentials are required, ask the user for the credentials, construct an HTTP request with the necessary parameters in a sandbox, and obtain the response. Treat the response as a web page response and get the main content as markdown.
- Whenever a user login is required, ask if they can log in so you can continue your search, obtain the authorization token by opening the address in a browser, wait for them to confirm they have logged in, obtain the authorization token, and use it to make the HTTP request or access the content via browser_action.
- In cases where attempts to obtain content have been frustrated up to the limit of attempts, try again with another strategy. One of them is to download the content via browser_action and then analyze it as a file with the extract_page_content or read_file tool.
